1. [Algorithms and Data Structures](./Algorithms-and-Data-Structures)
    - [Sorting Techniques](./Algorithms-and-Data-Structures/Sorting-Techniques)
      - [x] Java
      - [x] JavaScript
    - [Searching Techniques](./Algorithms-and-Data-Structures/Searching-Techniques)
      - [ ] Java 
      - [x] JavaScript

	<p>&nbsp; Data structure brings out organizing the data in memory since algorithm is a collection of steps to solve particular problem. 
	Here, I have brought out few sorting and searching algorithms to overcome above scenario. </p>
	
2. [Practical Tasks 01](./Practical-Tasks-01) 
    - [ ] Java
    - [x] JavaScript
 
 
+ Four practical Questions have implemented in single NodeJS server
