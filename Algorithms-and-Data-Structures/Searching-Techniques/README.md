# Search Algorithms

<p>Searching Algorithms are designed to check for an element or retrieve an element from any data structure where it is stored. Based on the type of search operation, 
  
  these algorithms are generally classified into two categories:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/sriThariduSangeeth/RAPID-T4-CL/tree/master/Algorithms-and-Data-Structures/Searching-Techniques/Binary-Search">Binary search</a>
  </li>
  
        Sequential Search : In this, the list or array is traversed sequentially and every element is checked.
  
  <li><a href="https://github.com/sriThariduSangeeth/RAPID-T4-CL/tree/master/Algorithms-and-Data-Structures/Searching-Techniques/Linear-Search">Linear Search</a>     </li>
  
        SInterval Search : These algorithms are specifically designed for searching in sorted data-structures. These type of searching algorithms are much more     efficient than Linear Search as they repeatedly target the center of the search structure and divide the search space in half
  
</ul>


> Linear Search vs Binary Search

- Input data needs to be sorted in Binary Search and not in Linear Search
- Linear search does the sequential access whereas Binary search access data randomly.
- Time complexity of linear search -O(n) , Binary search has time complexity O(log n).
- Linear search performs equality comparisons and Binary search performs ordering comparisons
