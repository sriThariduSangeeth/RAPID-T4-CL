<h1 align="center">Binary Search Tree</h1>
<h3>Practical Tasks 02 :star: :school_satchel: </h3> 

> NodeJS simpale application.

### Write a Programme :hourglass_flowing_sand:

- To print All leaf nodes of a binary tree where depth is grater than 10
- To demostrate PreOrder traversal of a binary tree. (Depth first search)
- To demonstrate InOrder traversal of a binary tree. (Depth first search)
- To demonstrate PostOrder traversal of a binary tree. (Depth first search)

#### This is a NodeJS Express Project and To run this project

1. Find Leaf Node in Binary Tree
   
   ````
        Leaf Nodes in tree :  [
	   5,  11,  42,  52,  54,
	  61, 137, 143, 188, 243
	]
	Print Minmum vlaue in tree :  3
	Print Maximum vlaue in tree :  243
	Print Maximum Height in tree :  7
	Print Minmum Height in tree :  1
